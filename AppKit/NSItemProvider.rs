Modified by "containerFrame" (below), which defines an enclosing clip rectangle, this provides the frame the item’s representation will start from, if it is animated into the service's UI.

The item will be understood to be fully visible, partially clipped, or not visible at all in the source window, according to whether this rectangle contains, intersects, or does not intersect the item's "sourceFrame".  The system may use this information to gradually reveal items as they are transitioned into a service UI.  Items that originate from the same view will typically have the same enclosing containerFrame, but making this per-item allows for gathering items from various enclosing source areas.  Defaults to NSZeroRect when an enclosing clip rectangle cannot be determined.  The system interprets that to mean that the item is fully visible (not clipped at all).

This might be different from the size at which the item is depicted in the host app source window (sourceFrame.size).  For an image, for example, this will be image’s natural size, since if the service UI provides editing functionality, natural size is likely to be the most appropriate or convenient scale for editing.  If the item is of a type whose size can be automatically determined (image, video, PDF, etc.), this property will be automatically derived when the item's primary representation is loaded.  When this is NSZeroSize, assume that the item's sourceFrame gives an appropriate size for displaying the item in the service UI.
